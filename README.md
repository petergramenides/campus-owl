# Campus OWL

**Campus Owl** is a MEAN stack application that allows users to create and update social media accounts that allow them to interact with other members of their campus community in safe, meaningful ways.


### Moderation

Moderation of this app will fall upon campus community members. In some cases it may make sense to allow campus administrators to moderate. In other cases, moderation may be left up to alumni or current students.

**Campus OWL** was designed for transparency, and as such, we have kept this project open source.

## Configuration

Setting up **Campus OWL** is very easy. Just download the files, open the repository in a bash terminal, and do ```ng serve```
